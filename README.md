### Heya! 👋

### A bit about me

I have a strong love for Rust, Python, and TypeScript, and I'm constantly diving into the coding universe. Besides that, I adore creating scrumptious dishes as passionately as writing code 🥗. My enthusiasm for learning knows no bounds! 🚀

### The vibe

:panda_face: My vibe is all about relaxation, writing quality code, sipping on tea like a true Canadian nerd, and embracing the joys of life 🍵
